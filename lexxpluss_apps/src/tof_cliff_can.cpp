 *
 * Short, and deliberately not the 100 ms the other zcan modules use. A frame this layer
 * cannot place is dropped, never retried -- by the time the mailbox drains, the range it
 * carries is stale, and sending a stale range is the one thing the contract forbids
 * outright. So waiting longer cannot change the outcome for that frame; it can only delay
 * the caller. The flush runs after the chain lock is released, so a long block here would
 * not stall the I2C schedule, but it would still push the next cycle out and would sit in
 * front of the heartbeat.
 *
 * Not zero either: a momentary mailbox contention should not drop a frame that is still
 * fresh. One millisecond is well under any plausible cycle period and long enough for the
 * controller to finish a frame already in flight at 1 Mbit/s. */
